  <what-built>Complete Phase 1: Manual teleprompter with broadcast-style display, smooth scrolling, adjustable speed/size, fullscreen mode, and settings persistence.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:**
1. Open index.html in your browser
2. Have a sample script ready (any paragraph of text, or use Lorem Ipsum)

**Test each requirement:**

**DISP-01: Script Input**
- [ ] Paste your script into the textarea
- [ ] Text appears in the input field

**DISP-02: Start/Pause Scrolling**
- [ ] Click "Start Teleprompter" button
- [ ] Click "Play" button - text scrolls smoothly
- [ ] Click "Pause" button - scrolling stops
- [ ] Press Space bar - toggles play/pause

**DISP-03: Adjust Scroll Speed**
- [ ] While scrolling, click "Speed +" - scrolling gets faster
- [ ] Click "Speed -" - scrolling slows down
- [ ] Press Up/Down arrows - speed adjusts

**DISP-04: Adjust Text Size**
- [ ] Click "Text +" - text gets larger
- [ ] Click "Text -" - text gets smaller
- [ ] Press +/- keys - text size adjusts

**DISP-05: Broadcast Style**
- [ ] Background is pure black
- [ ] Text is white
- [ ] Text is left-aligned (not centered)
- [ ] Reading marker line visible at top third of screen

**DISP-06: Fullscreen Mode**
- [ ] Click "Fullscreen" button - enters fullscreen
- [ ] Press Esc - exits fullscreen
- [ ] Press F key - toggles fullscreen

**Additional Checks:**
- [ ] Move mouse away for 3+ seconds - controls fade out
- [ ] Move mouse - controls reappear
- [ ] Click "Exit" - returns to editor with your script intact
- [ ] Refresh page, re-enter teleprompter - speed and text size settings preserved
- [ ] Scrolling is smooth, not jerky or stuttering

**Real-world test:**
- [ ] Read a paragraph aloud while scrolling - is the experience comfortable?
