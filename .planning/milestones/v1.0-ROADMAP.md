# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-24
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

This roadmap builds a voice-controlled teleprompter in four phases. Phase 1 establishes a solid manual teleprompter foundation. Phase 2 adds reliable speech recognition with comprehensive error handling. Phase 3 implements basic text matching to prove the concept. Phase 4 adds intelligence through confidence-based scroll control, completing the "teleprompter that follows you" experience.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Display & Manual Control

**Goal**: User can operate the app as a professional manual teleprompter
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: DISP-01, DISP-02, DISP-03, DISP-04, DISP-05, DISP-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can paste script text and see it displayed in broadcast style (dark background, large light text)
  2. User can manually scroll through script at adjustable speeds
  3. User can pause and resume scrolling from any point
  4. User can adjust text size to match reading distance
  5. User can enter fullscreen mode for distraction-free reading
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: HTML structure, CSS styling, mode switching
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Controls: Scrolling, speed/size controls, fullscreen, persistence
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Verification: Human testing of complete Phase 1

### Phase 2: Speech Recognition Foundation

**Goal**: App reliably captures and transcribes user speech with graceful error handling
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: VOICE-01, VOICE-02, VOICE-03, VOICE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User grants microphone permission and app begins listening
  2. User can see visual indicator showing when app is actively listening
  3. App continues listening through pauses without manual restart
  4. When speech recognition fails, app shows clear error and falls back to manual mode
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Speech recognition module with auto-restart and error handling
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Audio visualizer and UI elements (voice toggle, waveform indicator)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Integration, persistence, and human verification

### Phase 3: Basic Text Matching

**Goal**: App matches spoken words to position in script and scrolls accordingly
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: TRACK-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User speaks words from script and app scrolls to matching position
  2. User can paraphrase slightly and app still finds approximate match
  3. App highlights current matched position in the script
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — TextMatcher: Fuzzy matching engine with Fuse.js
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Highlighter: CSS Custom Highlight API for visual feedback
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Integration: Wire voice to matching to scroll

### Phase 4: Intelligent Scroll Control

**Goal**: App behaves like human operator - scrolling when confident, pausing when uncertain
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: TRACK-02, TRACK-03, TRACK-04, TRACK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User goes off-script (ad-lib, interjection) and scrolling pauses automatically
  2. User returns to script and scrolling resumes smoothly
  3. User skips ahead in script and app jumps to new position
  4. User can see visual confidence indicator showing how certain the match is
  5. Scrolling is smooth and natural, not jumpy or erratic
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Confidence calculator and AudioVisualizer confidence display
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Remove Highlighter dimming
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — TextMatcher confidence + ScrollSync state machine
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Integration and human verification

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Web app only for proof of concept (fastest path to usable)
- No authentication to reduce complexity
- Free AI only (Web Speech API, no paid APIs)
- Broadcast-style display (industry standard for readability)
- Fuse.js for fuzzy matching with 0.3 threshold
- CSS Custom Highlight API for zero-DOM highlighting
- State machine for scroll control (CONFIDENT/UNCERTAIN/OFF_SCRIPT)
- Phrase matching with 3-word windows

**Issues Resolved:**
- Speech recognition auto-restart on pause/error
- Exponential easing for smooth scroll transitions
- Skip detection with dwell time confirmation
- Stable word buffer from FINAL results only

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Tuning parameters may need adjustment for different scripts/speakers
- No automated tests yet
