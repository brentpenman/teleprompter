# v1.1 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.1 Following-Along Rewrite
**Audited:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All requirements satisfied. All phases complete with passing verifications. Cross-phase integration verified with 28/28 checks passing. End-to-end flows confirmed working. No critical gaps. No accumulated tech debt.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| MATCH-01 | Distance-weighted scoring intrinsic to match confidence | 5 | SATISFIED |
| MATCH-02 | Constrained radius around current position | 5 | SATISFIED |
| MATCH-03 | Consecutive word matches required | 5 | SATISFIED |
| MATCH-04 | Repeated phrases prefer near position | 5 | SATISFIED |
| POS-01 | Confirmed position as single source of truth | 6 | SATISFIED |
| POS-02 | Two-position model (floor + ceiling) | 6 | SATISFIED |
| POS-03 | Only update on high-confidence matches | 6 | SATISFIED |
| POS-04 | Monotonic constraint (forward only) | 6 | SATISFIED |
| SCROLL-01 | Never scroll past confirmed position | 7 | SATISFIED |
| SCROLL-02 | Next words at caret | 7 | SATISFIED |
| SCROLL-03 | Pause and hold on silence | 7 | SATISFIED |
| SCROLL-04 | Auto-resume on speech | 7 | SATISFIED |
| SCROLL-05 | Speed derived from speech pace | 7 | SATISFIED |
| SKIP-01 | Consecutive matches before large jumps | 6 | SATISFIED |
| SKIP-02 | Strong forward bias | 6 | SATISFIED |
| ARCH-01 | WordMatcher is stateless | 5 | SATISFIED |
| ARCH-02 | PositionTracker owns confirmed position | 6 | SATISFIED |
| ARCH-03 | ScrollController is purely reactive | 7 | SATISFIED |
| ARCH-04 | Old components removed | 8 | SATISFIED |
| VIS-01 | Tracking state indicator | 7 | SATISFIED |

**Score: 20/20 requirements satisfied (100%)**

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Status | Verification Date |
|-------|------|--------|-------------------|
| 5: WordMatcher | Stateless matching with distance-weighted scoring | PASSED | 2026-01-24T19:47:00Z |
| 6: PositionTracker | Two-position model with monotonic constraint | PASSED | 2026-01-24T17:22:45Z |
| 7: ScrollController | Reactive scroll with pace-derived speed | PASSED | 2026-01-24T20:15:00Z |
| 8: Integration | Wire pipeline, remove old components | PASSED | 2026-01-24T20:34:06Z |

**Score: 4/4 phases verified (100%)**

### Phase Details

**Phase 5: WordMatcher**
- 10/10 must-haves verified
- 14 tests passing
- All 5 requirements satisfied
- No anti-patterns found

**Phase 6: PositionTracker**
- 5/5 must-haves verified
- 33 tests passing
- All 7 requirements satisfied
- No anti-patterns found

**Phase 7: ScrollController**
- 6/6 must-haves verified
- 28 tests passing
- All 7 requirements satisfied
- Human verification completed (visual quality, timing feel)

**Phase 8: Integration**
- 11/11 must-haves verified
- Old components deleted (TextMatcher.js, ScrollSync.js, ConfidenceLevel.js)
- Pipeline wired and E2E verified
- Human verification completed (natural reading experience)

## Integration Verification

**Score: 28/28 integration checks passed (100%)**

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| From | To | Interface | Status |
|------|----|-----------| -------|
| WordMatcher | PositionTracker | MatchCandidate type | WIRED |
| PositionTracker | ScrollController | ProcessResult type | WIRED |
| ScrollController | PositionTracker | getConfirmedPosition() | WIRED |
| All phases | script.js | ES6 imports | WIRED |

### Export Usage

All 9 module exports are connected:
- createMatcher: 21 references
- findMatches: 20 references
- PositionTracker: 66 references
- ScrollController: 32 references
- textUtils functions: All used

No orphaned exports.

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Speech → Scroll | User speaks → match found → position advances → scroll moves | COMPLETE |
| Pause → Resume | User pauses → tracking holds → user resumes → tracking continues | COMPLETE |
| Skip Detection | User skips ahead → consecutive matches → position jumps | COMPLETE |

**Score: 3/3 flows verified (100%)**

### Regression Checks

- Old TextMatcher: Removed (0 references)
- Old ScrollSync: Removed (0 references)
- Old ConfidenceLevel: Removed (0 references)
- Direct position manipulation: None (PositionTracker owns state)
- Direct scroll manipulation: None (ScrollController owns animation)

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated. All phases completed without deferred items, TODOs, or placeholders.

## Gaps Found

None.

## Conclusion

**v1.1 Following-Along Rewrite milestone COMPLETE.**

The entire position-tracking and scroll system has been rewritten from first principles:
- WordMatcher provides stateless, distance-weighted fuzzy matching
- PositionTracker maintains confirmed position as single source of truth
- ScrollController reactively responds to position changes
- Old v1.0 components cleanly removed

The teleprompter now follows the user naturally, confirming where they ARE rather than predicting where they'll BE.
